# Data Process
## Overview
- Pre-processing: reducing variables and cleaning columns with inconsistent data.
- Merge each individual Sales{year} file to its associated Parcel{year} file.
- Append all of the resultant datasets, creating a single dataset containing all sales with their associated parcel data from the year of the sale.
- Post-processing: based on research methodology.
- Fuzzy matching to identify ownership.
